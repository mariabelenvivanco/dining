# Special Features: 
Countdown for open/closing of chosen dining hall: done by retrieving the time and day of week of android to retrieve the schedule of that specified time and day -> calculates time remaining based on the ranges given by the schedule for that given day 

Schedule: gives users autonomy of planning ahead for other meals

# Progress 

Currently shows New Dorm dining hall times
Future: Extend to Erdman and Uncommon Grounds 

# Special Thanks 
Thank you to the Google Applied CS team for teaching us the skills to pursue this app!
